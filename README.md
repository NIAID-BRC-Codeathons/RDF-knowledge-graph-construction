# RDF Knowledge Graph Construction

Transforming Pathogen Data Network Resources to RDF using Large Language Models

## About This Project

This is a project from the **NIAID BRC AI Codeathon 2025**, taking place November 12-14, 2025 at Argonne National Laboratory.

**Event Website:** https://niaid-brc-codeathons.github.io/

**Project Details:** https://niaid-brc-codeathons.github.io/projects/RDF-knowledge-graph-construction/

## Codeathon Goals

The NIAID Bioinformatics Resource Centers (BRCs) invite researchers, data scientists, and developers to a three-day AI Codeathon focused on improving Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability ($

## Futur work

- Incorporate additional PDN  data sources to improve coverage and insights.
- Optimize process to limit data duplication.
- Ensure schema profile covers all use cases. Potential alignment with existing schema profiles.
- Curate additional examples (NL Queries and associated SPARQL Queries) to enhance the LLM performance when responding to a new user question.
- Turn the online pipeline into an MCP server for improved utility.
